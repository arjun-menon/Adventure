Implement Entity::moveBy

Time-based FPS-independent physics

step_multiple(...) -- use variadic templates

~TexImpl: frees the Tex

Maybe the Entity class needs protected mutable data members & public const getters

SideScrollingView: takes a PhysicsMap & a single _pivot_ Entity -- and draws map "around" it. 

add consts to Tex -- i.e. ptr<const Tex>

velocity transfer upon collision

In SideScrollingMap, you might want to request const references to PhysicsMap & pivot (as initializers).
